# Blame calculus

Sam:  Btw, the blame calculus work is something I did originally in my 2006 paper
Wadler and Findler s paper is a follow on to that
 me:  Oh!
Will correct that.
 Sam:  I didn't call it blame calculus
But the idea of using contracts is from my paper

# Punctuation

ambrosebs: One minor nitpick -- it looks like there's some missing punctuation at the beginning of page 10. 
kushal has joined the room 23:21  
kaonashi_ has joined the room 23:21

ambrosebs: personally, I'd add a semicolon and a comma, as such: "...for many uses; where other languages might use objects, Clojure ..."
ambrosebs: ...but either way, the sentence seems like it's expressing two ideas without as much syntactic separation as should be there.
