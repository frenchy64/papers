\chapter{Design Choices}

Typed Clojure is designed to be of practical use to Clojure programmers.
Many of the design goals are similar to Tobin-Hochstadt's \cite{SAMTH:dissertation}
for Typed Racket.

\section{Typed Racket}

The majority of the design and implementation of Typed Clojure is based on Typed Racket.

\subsection{Occurrence Typing}
% interesting paths
% - count path element
% - class path element
% - keyword path element

\subsection{Variable-arity Polymorphism}
% Problematic areas
% - flattened paired arguments. assoc, hash-maps, array-map
% - complex argument dependencies. comp, partial

\section{Safer Host Interoperability}
% Args non-nil, return nilable
% Constructors and other special methods handled appropriately (eg. Constructor are non-nil return)
% TODO refine language Clojure vs. Clojure JVM

% what is this paragraph saying?
Dialects of Clojure provide fast and unrestricted access to their host platform. 
This is a intentional source of incompatibility between dialects.
For example, Clojure is hosted on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), ClojureCLR on the Common Language Runtime (CLR),
and ClojureScript on Javascript VMs. These are very different platforms, and it is unlikely
a Clojure dot call will be portable. There is no attempt at reconciling
host interoperability differences, and it is up to the programmer to decide
how to best abstract over different hosts.

Typed Clojure targets the JVM hosted Clojure.
Clojure embraces the JVM as a host by sharing its runtime type system and encouraging direct
interaction with libraries written in other JVM languages. Most commonly, Clojure programmers
reach to Java libraries. Java is statically typed language. It follows that any interaction with
Java will already have an annotated Java type. Typed Clojure can use these annotations
to statically type check these interactions.

Typed Clojure attempts to improve some shortcomings of Java's type system.

Java's static type system does not provide a type-safe construct for eliminating
the \lstinline|null| pointer. Instead, Java programmers often rely on either testing
for \lstinline|null| or prior domain knowledge.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=null elimination in Java]
...
Object a = nextObject();
if (a != null)
  parseNextObject(a);
else
  throw new Exception("null Pointer Found!);
...
\end{lstlisting}



In Java, \lstinline|null| is a subtype to all reference
types, but \lstinline|null| is not expressible as a static type. In other words,
when a Java type claims a reference type, you should also assume it can also be of 
type \lstinline|null|.



Scala provides the Option type for safe \lstinline|null| elimination, forcing pattern matching
where \lstinline|null| might occur.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=null elimination in Scala]
TODO
\end{lstlisting}

Clojure 

\subsection{Primitive Arrays}
% Primitive arrays are covariant, which is well-known to be statically unsound.
% We cannot trust the type signature of any Java method or field.
% Separate read and write types into two parameters.

\subsection{Interaction with null}
% null is explicitly expressible in my type system
% In Java, null is subtype of all reference types, any reference type must be tested to prevent NPE
% 

\subsection{Generic Java}
% Existential types are needed to fully express Generic Java types in Typed Clojure
% F-bounded polymorphism supported


\section{Optional Type Checking}
\section{Local Type Inference}

Similar to Typed Racket, type inference is based on Local Type Inference
by Pierce and Turner.

\section{F-bounded Polymorphism}

Typed Clojure includes support for F-bounds on type variables, as an extension
to Local Type Inference. 

An extra environment from type variables to bounds is kept until after inference,
after which each unground bound is substituted with the inferred types and the
subtyping relationships are checked.

\section{Heterogeneous Maps}
% keyword keys for now, generally encouraged, fast
% Some heterogeneous maps have string args, eg. from web frameworks

% Operational semantics

\subsection{Operational Semantics}

\subsection{Higher-order Variable-arity Polymorphism (SKETCH)}

Practical Variable-arity Polymorphism introduces the concept of a dotted type parameter,
representing a sequence of types, allowing non-uniform variable parameters.
This enables \lstinline|map| and other function with complex arguments to be typed.
Strickland, Tobin-Hochstadt, and Felleisen's approach is solves almost all variable-arity applications in
Typed Racket, and is a key feature of Typed Racket's implementation.

Idiomatic variable-arity functions in Clojure's are even more sophisticated than Typed Racket, requiring extensions
to Typed Racket's approach to type check satisfactorily. The Clojure core library favours functions with
variable parameters, especially in a higher-order context. For example, \lstinline|assoc|
associates key-value pairs to a target map. It takes one or more key-value pairs and
applies them left-to-right to the target map. The key problem from a typing perspective
is \lstinline|assoc|'s arguments are flattened, resulting in \lstinline|assoc| only
accepting an even number of rest arguments. \lstinline|assoc| is also commonly used as a
higher-order function.
\lstinline|assoc| cannot be expressed in Typed Racket. For instance,
dotted parameters represent an unrestricted number of types, where we require an even number.

The nature of Clojure's idiomatic variable-arity functions suggest we must introduce
new kinds of dotted parameters. Three main issues must be considered in the context of Typed Clojure.
Firstly, subtyping between different kinds of dotted and rest
\footnote{A rest parameter consumes zero or more types, rather than being a sequence of types.}
parameters can be tricky, only made trickier by adding new kinds of dotted parameters.
Secondly, elimination rules for dotted parameters in many frequently used Clojure core functions
difficult to express.
Thirdly, higher-order functions taking functions with dotted arguments commonly 
The first issue requires careful design and implementation.
The second and third points require new constructs, in the form of \emph{projections}
and abstractions over \emph{dotted} parameters, respectively.
