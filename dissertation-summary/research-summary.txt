An Optional Static Type System for Clojure

Author: Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant
Supervisor: Rowan Davies

Dynamically typed languages (also known as monotyped) are designed to be convenient for
writing programs quickly, and aspire to get out of the programmer's
way as much as possible. When programs grow large and stabilize,
some features of static languages are missed, specifically static
type checking. 

Tobin-Hochstadt notes that "untyped scripts are difficult to 
maintain over the long run" because types
contain valuable design information.
He developed Typed Scheme to safely and incrementally port existing 
Scheme code, a dynamic language, to
Typed Scheme, a static language.

Clojure is a dynamically typed, functional language with 
implementations for the Java Virtual
Machine and Common Language Runtime, and compiling to Javascript. Clojure
is also a Lisp, which makes it a good candidate to test the generality of
ideas developed for Typed Scheme 

This project will explore designing and adding an optional type system to Clojure.
It will be based on the lessons learnt throught the development
of Typed Scheme, and as a response to Tobin-Hochstadt's
suggestion to add type systems to other existing dynamic languages.
